# SWE3033-F2022
SKKU Database Project Fall 2022

This course is mainly based on the last year's course, thanks to the contribution of Dr. An and Dr. Park.

- Instructor: Prof. Sang-Won Lee (swlee@skku.edu)
- TA
    - Jong-Hyeok Park (akindo19@skku.edu)
    - Bo-Hyun Lee (lia323@skku.edu)

## Introduction

Almost every important computer application must manage, update, and query databases using a database system(s) that best fits its workload. In this course, you will learn the three most popular database systems and their major workloads:

- MySQL and TPC-C (*OLTP workload*)
- RocksDB and YCSB (*Key-value store workload*)
- SQLite and AndroBench (*Mobile workload*)

From these three projects, you can learn how each database system works and understand the characteristics of popular workloads. You can also learn how to measure key (performance-related) metrics and analyze their impacts on performance.
