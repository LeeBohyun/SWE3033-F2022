# PA 2: Compare Space Amplification in MySQL and RocksDB


# Overview
For PA2, you will measure the space amplification factor in MySQL and RocksDB. Also, choose one DBMS and propose ways to mitigate space amplification further.

You should include the followings in your report:
- Space amplification of MySQL and RocksDB
- Ways to reduce space amplification in either MySQL or RocksDB
